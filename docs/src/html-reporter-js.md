The HTML reporter produces a self-contained folder containing a report for the test run which can be served as a web page.

A quick way of opening the last test run report is:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

The report shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, failed tests, skipped tests etc.
