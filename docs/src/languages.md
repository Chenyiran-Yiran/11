Playwright Library API is available in multiple languages listed below. All core features are supported in all language
port. There are some slight differences when it comes to browser specific APIs, e.g. Chromium extension debugging or CDP
session are currently not available in Java but apart from that we maintain feature partity in language ports with
Playwright for Node.js.

Playwright for Node.js comes with it's own test runner that provides great parallelization mechanism, screenshot
assertions, html reporter, automatic tracing etc. Playwright Test runner is only available in Node.js version. In other
languages Playwright supports integration with existing test runner frameworks (e.g. pytest in Python, JUnit or TestNG
in Java, NTest or MSTest in .NET).
